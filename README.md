# What is this?
This is a client for the service [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) intended for GNOME and other XDG compatible desktops. This was originally inspired by [this project](https://github.com/erinaceous/gtk-pushbullet). While I would have rather just contributed to that project, I figured I would be able to get a lot more done if I started a project that was compatible license-wise with [pyPushBullet](https://github.com/Azelphur/pyPushBullet).
It should be noted that as of right now this is mostly a proof of concept, although I hope to have more functionality added soon.

# Requirements
- PyGObject
- [pyPushBullet](https://github.com/Azelphur/pyPushBullet)

# How to launch
Since this is very early in the development process, there's no way to install this using pip or any other methods yet. For now, you can just run
```
./src/client.py
```

To test it out.
